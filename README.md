ðŸ“Š Task 1: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

This project focuses on cleaning and preparing a raw dataset by addressing common data quality issues such as missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formats, and incorrect data types.
The task was completed using Python (Pandas) and/or Excel.

Removed duplicate rows using .drop_duplicates()

Standardized categorical text data (e.g., gender, country names)

Converted date columns to a consistent format (dd-mm-yyyy)

Renamed column headers for clarity and consistency

Corrected data types (e.g., integers for age, datetime objects for dates)

Deliverables:
